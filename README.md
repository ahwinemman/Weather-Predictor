# Weather-Predictor
A Weather Predictor application that allows the weather of any city to be determined. The data is obtained from the url resource  "http://www.weather-forecast.com/locations/".$city."/forecasts/latest" and then parsed to collect relevant information to be displayed on the Weather Predictor Application UI.
I used a local xampp server to build this project.
